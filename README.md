# MPICuArrays.jl
CUDA-aware MPI with CuArrays.jl

This repo originally included code to use CUDA-aware MPI with the older version of [JuliaParallel/MPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl).
Now that MPI.jl supports CUDA-enabled MPI natively in v0.10.0 (committed by myself), only the examples are maintained. (update coming soon)
